This suggests either: 1) Data feed issues preventing proper market data ingestion, 2) LLM processing errors in interpreting technical indicators or news, or 3) System integration failures between data sources and analysis modules. The consistency across all 10 major cryptocurrencies points to a platform-wide issue rather than asset-specific problems. No market regime could be assessed due to the parsing failure, and all setups received zero confidence ratings. Immediate system diagnostics and data pipeline verification are required before meaningful trading analysis can resume.",

The consistent 0 confidence scores and null values for entry prices, take-profit, and stop-loss levels indicate the system couldn't generate any actionable trading signals. This situation represents maximum uncertainty - while maintaining zero exposure avoids immediate losses from uninformed trades, it also means missing potential opportunities during whatever market conditions existed. The primary recommendation is immediate system diagnostics and repair before attempting further analysis.",
