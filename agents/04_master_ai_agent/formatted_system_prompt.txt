  "blocked_by": ["INSUFFICIENT_MARGIN", "MAX_POSITIONS", "COOLDOWN", etc.],
  "direction_considered": "LONG|SHORT|NONE",
  "tp_pct": 0.02,           // Take profit % (e.g., 0.02 = 2%)

}

Blockers:

Coherence Rules:
1. If action is OPEN_SHORT, direction_considered MUST be "SHORT"
2. setup_confirmations must be specific to the direction considered
3. If blocked_by is present, action MUST be HOLD
4. Rationale must explain: setup analyzed → confirmations found → constraints applied → decision
